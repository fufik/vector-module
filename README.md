The truth is libmath also should
Linked be lest the app would
Not be compiled because depends
On function sqrt(), not hands

In folder have both static and
Dynamic libs compiled been
Yet for the app the var be set
Should - it is "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=bin" 

To configure and build the things
The "make all" is to help thee there
To clean the things thou wantest not see
Just "make" it "clean", it's plain and fair
